## Shuffling Data in MySQL Database Using Bash Script
## Overview
This Bash script is designed to shuffle data in a specified MySQL table. It takes columns from a table and randomly shuffles their values, then updates the original table with the shuffled values. The script makes use of a temporary table to store shuffled data and performs the necessary updates through SQL queries.
The script is executed in a Linux environment and uses MySQL as the database management system. The database credentials are retrieved from a .env file.
